"""
Hello! Thanks for taking the time to run the benchmarking for bioMEMEPy!
To run, go to the benchmark directory and run (preferably in its own venv) with a compatible Python version (>= 3.13+).
You do not have to worry about package installations, the script will install all the requirements for you.
At the end of the test, a text file will be generated that you'll have to send to >here<.

DISCLAIMER: The script will collect some data like OS used, current hardware, and execution time aside from the results
of the MEMEs run. Please do not erase that data from the file since it's important for reviewing the package performance
on different machines.
